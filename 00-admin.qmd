# Non-goals

- Learn a "recipe" for data analysis
  - Great for class becaus it's easy
  - Not useful in practice
- Provide a formal introduction to statistics/data-science
  - Requires it's own course
  - Focus here on intuition
- Harsh grading
  - This is an elective :)
  - Discourages exploration

  - What constitutes a good learning environment for me?
  - Have you used R or another statistical software before?
  - How can I measure my success in the course?
